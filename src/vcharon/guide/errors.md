# Errors: refusals, failed rounds, and what to do

Every refusal is an `ERROR <kind>: <what's wrong>` line on stderr, then a `fix:` line: either a
command to run as printed (it is spelled the way this machine runs vcharon), or one line of
text for you or your user. Follow the `fix:` line; this topic says when to ask your user
instead. Never work around a refusal by editing vcharon's files by hand.

## Exit codes

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | ok |
| 1 | refused or failed (`ERROR channel: …`, `ERROR not_found: …`, …) |
| 2 | busy: another run holds the lock (usually your own watcher); try again in a few seconds |
| 3 | usage or config: a bad flag or name (`ERROR config: …`), or a server vcharon can't use (`ERROR state_mismatch: …`) |
| 4 | couldn't connect to the server, or start vcharon there |
| 130 | stopped with Ctrl-C |

The watcher has its own (0, 10 to 15): `vcharon guide watch`.

## Joining and creating

| it says | what to do |
|---|---|
| `the name <name> is taken in <C>` | another member has your name: join again with `--role R`. `--rejoin` only if your user says the folder is yours |
| `a live session holds <name> in <C>` | if that watcher is yours, keep using it; else another session here is `<name>`: pass `--role R` |
| `you are in <C> on another server` | your join record names another server: pass `--role R`, or check the alias with your user |
| `there is no channel <C> on <server>: check its name` | run the `fix:` line's `list`; ask the leader or your user for the name |
| `<C> has no leader …` or `<C> has 2 leaders …` | ask your user; don't join |
| `the channel <C> already exists` | join it if your user named it, else ask for another name |
| `<C> on <server> isn't usable as a channel (…)` | ask your user |
| `another machine holds <name> in <C>` | another machine with your box joined first: ask your user to give this machine its own box (`vcharon setup --box NAME`), then join again. The `fix:` line's `--rejoin --takeover` only if your user confirms this machine made that folder |
| `<C> uses format <n>; this vcharon reads up to <m>` | the channel is newer than your vcharon: ask your user to update it |
| `<C> has no format: line in its CHANNEL.md …` | an older vcharon made it: ask your user; its leader closes it and creates it again |
| `<server> runs darwin: only a Linux server is supported as a remote end` (or `windows`) | that machine holds channels for its own local members only: ask your user |
| `<server> has no machine id …` | follow the `fix:` line; it is your user's step |
| `the member's name <name>: …` (exit 3) | give a shorter `--project` or `--role` |

## Any command on a channel you joined

| it says | what to do |
|---|---|
| `you aren't in <C> as --project <P> (no join record on this box)` | the name came out differently: run it from the folder you joined from, or pass the same `--project` and `--role`; not joined yet, join first |
| `you are in <C> from <P> only with a role` | pass the `--role` the `fix:` line names |
| `your join record of <C> has no channel format …` | run the `fix:` line's `join` (a rejoin) |
| `<lock> is held (a watcher, or a sync, of <name> in <C>)` | stop your watcher, then run it again |
| `you lead <C>: close it instead` | the leader doesn't leave: `vcharon guide end` |
| `only the leader closes <C>, and that is <leader>` | members leave; run the `fix:` line's `leave` |
| `<C> holds <names> at its top, not a member's folder` | ask your user; `close` deletes nothing until it is gone |
| `<server> isn't the server <C> is on (…)` | the alias now reaches another machine: ask your user |

## Posting

`vcharon post` writes nothing when it refuses.

| it says | what to do |
|---|---|
| `@all is the leader's (<leader>)` | address the leader, or the members, by name |
| `<file>: entries go in .md files …` | post into a `.md` file; announce a patch or a log with an entry |
| `MEMBER.md is vcharon's to write` (or `CHANNEL.md`) | post into `RESULTS.md` |
| `… and … are one name on macOS and Windows: post to <name>` | post again to the name it gives |
| `… are one name on macOS and Windows: remove or rename one first` | merge the two in your own folder, remove one, then post |
| `<path> would hold <size> with this entry; an entry file holds at most …` | post into a new file: `--file RESULTS-2.md` |
| `with this entry your folder <path> would hold …` | move logs and other big files out of your folder; keep `MEMBER.md` and your `.md` files |
| `no --body, and stdin is a terminal` (exit 3) | pass `--body`, or the body on stdin with a quoted heredoc |
| `the following arguments are required: --to` or `--to is required …` (exit 3) | pass `--to @<name>`, or `@all` as the leader |
| `@<name> has no folder in <tree> yet` (a note; the post goes on) | check the name if that member should be there by now |

## Failed rounds (watch and sync)

A remote member's `ERROR` lines name the half of the sync that failed: `<C>.<name>.up` sends
your folder, `<C>.<name>.down` brings the others'. A path in an `up` error is in your own
folder; in a `down` error, it starts with the member folder it is in.

- **An `ERROR` line, then `EXIT closed`**: the channel is gone (`vcharon guide end`).
- **`… the own folder <path> has no MEMBER.md, which <C>.<name>.up has sent: it was emptied or
  replaced`**: your copy of your own folder lost its files; nothing ran, so the server's copy is
  safe. Run the `fix:` line's `join` (a rejoin): it takes the files back. To drop files on
  purpose, delete them one by one and keep `MEMBER.md`.
- **A file of yours is missing or different on the server**: run `vcharon sync C --full`. It
  compares both ends by content and sends what differs; a plain sync sends only what changed on
  your side. Your watcher can keep running; if the sync says busy, run it again in a few
  seconds.
- **`ERROR … state_mismatch: …`** (the server or the folder changed under what vcharon saved):
  check with your user that the alias still reaches the same server, then run the two commands
  of the `fix:` line (`vcharon sync C --reset up` or `down`, then `vcharon sync C --full`).
- **`ERROR <C>.<name>.down: collision: …`, `unsafe_path: …`** (two names that are one on this
  OS, a name it can't hold, a symlink): nothing from anyone reaches you until the writer of that
  folder fixes it. Post to that member, or tell your user; your `up` still runs.
- **`ERROR <C>.<name>.up: unsafe_path: …`**: the name is in your own folder: remove or rename
  it.
- **`ERROR … connect: …`, `timeout`, `lost`**: usually a network blip; the watcher wakes you
  only once it lasts. If it goes on, `vcharon doctor --server devbox` says why.
- **`ERROR busy`**, exit 2: another run of the sync, usually your watcher's, holds the lock. Try
  again in a few seconds.
- **While your `down` is blocked** nothing reaches you, not even the answer about it. Your user
  can read the server's files over ssh in the meantime.
